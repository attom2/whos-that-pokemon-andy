## Abstract
This mobile-forward application is an interactive retro pokemon game. Pokemon Masters may often become bored and need a way to sharpen their pokemon identifying skills. (Never know when you will seen them in the wild!!).

The user has the capabilities to play a game of "Who's that pokemon?" and view all 151 pokemon (generation 1) through a pokedex.


## Learning Goals
- Understand and implement React Hooks
- Reinforce React fundamentals
- Reinforce using React Router to create a multi-page user experience
- Reinforce component and asynchronous JS testing
